Hello! 
My name is Khristin. 
I have far too many interests and I don't sleep enough. 
My dad is cool.

When I was a kid I had an Art Stand- you know, like how kids sell lemonade on hot days? 
I sold art. 
An Illustration of the sign from my Art stand.

In August of 2021, I was given my first computer as a gift and I've learned something new about it everyday. 
This portfolio is a collection of all of my projects so far.

I enthusiastically welcome contributions, chats, advice. Get in touch- I would love to hear from you!
